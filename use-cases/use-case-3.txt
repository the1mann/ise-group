The coach thinks of a brand new strategy while in the shower. 
Quickly he jumps onto his computer and adds the team event and bike, 
enters a new strategy and runs one simulation to see whether it's feasible.

This is assuming Events, Bikes, and Cyclists have all been previously entered in to the system previously.

He does the following:
	-set event
	-set bike
	-selects 3 riders
	-enters strategy
	-runs simulation
