The coach is preparing for the teams participation in the Tour de France. They add the details of a new bike which the entire team will be using for the Tour, then create a new Road Cycling event to match the specifications of the Tour de France. They choose four of their cyclists (who were entered into the program at an earlier date) and configure a simulation using these four cyclists, each using the new bike and have the program run a series of simulations to determine the best strategy to use during the event.
