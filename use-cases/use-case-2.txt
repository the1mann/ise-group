Use case 2

Pursuit Cycling with 3 people 
The coach has an pursuit cycling event coming up in the next few weeks and he wants to work out the optimal strategy for the event.
He already has a squad of riders saved in the system.
He already has a garage of bikes to choose from.
The event is already saved in the system from previously.

He will tick the optimization check box on the GUI
He will enter the number of simulations that the optimization program will call(call it value n).
He will select the event, the bike and 3 riders.
He will set a range of strategies to try.
The optimzation function will return the result that is feasible with the lowest time.


He will do the following:
	- Enters how many simulations the optimization program will run.
	- Set event
	- Set Bike
	- Chooses 3 cyclists
	- Sets the optimization parameters.
	- Run the optimization which returns the best feasbile strategy.
