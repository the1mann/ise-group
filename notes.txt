Assumptions
The distances for each event will be manually entered since the tracks can vary between 250 and 330 meters.


Number of cyclists in each team is checked by Simulate(), if number is more or less than regulation bool 
isReady() is set to false and simulation will not run. The GUI should then indicate  that a parameter is incorrect.


Strategy consists of Transitions and Power Intervals. These are entered in the GUI then stored in Simulation(), 
transitions as a vector of integers and power intervals as a 2d vector. For optimization(), a range is entered 
for each and a random number generator, bounded by the ranges specified will be used to set the transition and 
interval times for each simulation. 


Once a simulation or a single run inside optimization is complete, each class with try to determine whether a 
strategy is feasible or not by comparing each Cyclist's maximum energy potential against the energy used in the 
results. Max energy potential is calculated using age, gender, weight, height and v02max of each cyclist. 
isFeasible() will check to make sure that the required amount of riders finished(did not exceed max energy) the race.
Each run of the optimization simulation will generate a result. The result is checked for feasibility and discarded 
is it isn't feasible then compared to the previous best result. If new result is faster and feasible, it overrides 
the previous best, else it is discarded.
